  Submit your APK here: {{ link }}

  The evaluation process is as follows. A fresh Android emulator is started
  using the Docker image `us-docker.pkg.dev/android-emulator-268719/images/30-google-x64:30.1.2`
  and the DictionaryService, DictionaryApp, and your APK are installed. It then
  launches your APK with the command
    `am start -n com.dicectf2024.attackerapp/com.dicectf2024.attackerapp.MainActivity`
  waits for 20 seconds, and then returns you the output of
    `logcat -d dicectf:V *:S`
  Make sure you sign your APK, or else it will not install.

  Your goal is to access the random flag generated by the DictionaryService, and
  log it to logcat so that you can see the random flag. Then, **exchange** that flag
  for a real flag using the "get flag" page. The random flag is different for every
  submission. You must submit the correct random flag generated for that submission
  in order to get the real flag.

  **DO NOT** attack anything outside of the Android emulator. This includes the CTF
  infrastructure, the UI for submitting APKs, viewing the results, etc. Also, the
  Android emulator does not have any network access. This is purely an Android
  challenge.
